### Hi there 👋

My name is Nilton, I'm a senior software engineer, mostly focused on the UI. I have an extensive experience on front-end development over the past 8 years, coming from using jQuery as the main tool when working as _web developer_ and extensively using React and Vue over the last 5 years.
Despite my tendency to work on the UI, I have solid experience with frameworks like Django and Laravel. Therefore, working with Node should be frictionless.

- 🧑‍💻 I work mainly with React, Redux, Redux Sagas, TypeScript, Ramda, and alike
- 🌱 I’m willing to learn better approaches on tests
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can benefit society
- 👀 I’m eager to grasp electronics, new approaches for UI development, functional programming and shell script
